     <div class="city"><center><h1>About The Company</h1></center>
<p>Our company, The Wave, is an industry leader in recycling technology. It has become increasingly apparent that littering in our communities is becoming a major issue which needs to be addressed. Our newest project gives the everyday person more of an incentive to clean up after their community, alieving much of the damage done to our streets and sidewalks. It works through local grocery stores as to not be too much of an inconvenience for our users. A user of our application would first collect trash in the forms of bottles and cans that they find in their community, bring it to their local grocery store, exchange it similar to how they would normally would, and receive a ticket with a barcode. This ticket would be scanned by our application, and money would be transported to the account accordingly</p>

<div class="dirty"><center><h1>About Us</h1></center><p>The Wave started off, as many things do, as nothing but an idea. After becoming more experienced with coding, three high school students wondered what they could create that would be beneficial to their communities. While attending a site visit, they noticed the sheer amount of bottles and cans that were just left on the city's sidewalks. This sparked in an idea in the group - they could use their coding skills to create an application geared towards recycling.</p></div>
