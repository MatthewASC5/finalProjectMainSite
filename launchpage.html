                <pl>Our company, The Wave, is an industry leader in recycling technology. It has become increasingly apparent that littering in our communities is becoming a major issue which needs to be addressed. Our newest project gives the everyday person more of an incentive to clean up after their community, alieving much of the damage done to our streets and sidewalks. It works through local grocery stores as to not be too much of an inconvenience for our users. A user of our application would first collect trash in the forms of bottles and cans that they find in their community, bring it to their local grocery store, exchange it similar to how they would normally would, and receive a ticket with a barcode. This ticket would be scanned by our application, and money would be transported to the account accordingly.</p>
